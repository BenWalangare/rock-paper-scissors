# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Description
Yes, this game has been played for generations, and it is also a cross-cultural
game. I actually make two versions of this game. The one that's played with a
prompt only, and the other with the UI. I'll focus on the latter, but will make
definitely put a link to play with the prompt only.

The aim of this project is creating rock paper scissors game with JS logic, DOM
manipulation, and also the event listener.

This game, I utilized the JS. Yes, the power of JS. I declare a new variable
with DOM manipulation and style it with CSS later on. Use of `addEventListener`
to target the image to be clicked on.

This might be not well optimized and there are plenty of rooms for improvement.
I will surely fix the code and make it shorter later on.

Here some of the methods I used to build this game: 
 - `Math.ceil` and `Math.random` to generate random computer choices
 - DOM manipulation to target the images
 - `if` `else if`, to create the game rules
 - `addEventListener` on `click` on rock, paper, and scissors images

## What's next?
Next would be:
 - Create separate html page for old js before adding UI
 - Displaying the computer's choice; the image of RPS
 - Change the textMsg to borderless, so it won't confuse the player
 - Adding animation when user hovers over the images
 - Better looks and feels, overhaul them
 - And lastly, Indonesian version of RPS; the "Pingsut"
